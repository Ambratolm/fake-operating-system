# ![Icon](./FakeOS/icon.ico?raw=true) Fake Operating System (FakeOS)

As the name tells, this is an application that imitates a simplistic imaginary desktop operating system graphical user interface.<br/>
This can be used in movies and videos involving computer related scenes and subjects when an unknown imaginary desktop operating system is more suited for the story universe than just showing a real known one like Windows, MacOS and Linux.<br/>
I primarily made this application for [some YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/7n4RD1B7hOE?t=285).

- Messages app showing offline and online users to chat with.
  - Messaging with keyboard and [MSN Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Messenger) sound effects.
  - Simulate the role of your fake contact by pressing `Control` key. It will hide the text in the message text box when you type and show that the other user is typing you a message. ![Screenshot](./screenshot2.gif?raw=true)
